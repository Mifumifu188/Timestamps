1:00:50 thanks for the year of support
1:02:03 q&a too lazy to paste questions on stream
1:02:42 q1: about if she could pick how she looks like? no
1:04:25 q2:asking about the trackers: headsets VR on,nobody had VR except for ame, everyone had to get and set up
1:05:32 want to teach them how to do it themselves
1:07:13 q3:a project that she wished that gone different?cant think on anything

1:08:15 maybe will upload the performance on twitter, oh right PPP
1:08:30 q4:activity she would like to do when myth meets each other?
1:08:48 gura said twister ,seems fun
1:08:59 go to a parfait and BBQ and chat
1:09:24 q5:how does it feels to be the one everyone relays?
1:09:42 she likes doing it,everyone is independent ,ina is helpful ,they tried to help kiara with stuff
 talking about kiara tweet yesterday what was the issue
1:11:22 q6:struggle with imposter syndrome?
1:11:50 But I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing because I don't wanna get to a point where I'm like 'YEAH I GOT A MILLION SUBS!'" and I don't wanna talk like I'm better than them. Not like I don't acknowledge it, but I just wanna be equal with you guys! Does that make sense?
1:12:57 Q: "Back near debut, we asked a lot about first impressions. How do you feel you have changed, whether in a subtle or significant way?
1:13:33 i still doing the same stuff, havent changed much, the mic sounds pretty different
1:14:12 feeling better since yesterday about her cold
1:14:35  q: updated goals?
1:14:48 we could make more, 2 millions subvs
1:15:07 a holo game, an original song,improve japanese
1:15:33 more 3d stuff and travel to japan
1:15:59 q:persuit about marine biologist?
1:16:26 never really though about it
1:16:53 likes it as hobby
1:17:16 would like to learn EMT, maybe anatomy stream
1:17:58 Q: "Since everyone in Myth has 3D now, do you plan on organizing more collab 3D streams and will any them involve twister?
1:18:13 I guess you guys have to wait and find out! I did spoil it yesterday... but I won't spoil it. ... mostly 'cause I don't know whether it's happening or not
1:19:04 Q:criteria for streamable games?
1:19:21 case by case situation,depends on how she feels at the time
1:19:32 talking about the stress involved and reasons why sometimes they cant stream
1:21:54 original sketch for the map
1:22:25 hic 8
1:23:33 we gonna use it more
1:23:47 Q:family opinion about being a member of hololive?
1:23:57 Well, y'know... I feel like they don't understand it that much, other than seeing me as a muppet, but that's good, 'cause they like Muppets
1:25:09 Q: "Was there any activity that you weren't motivated to start, but got really into when you actually tried it?"
1:25:27 i think its a bait question, sounds like cooking
1:26:01 Q : asking about the creative process
1:26:41 Yeah, they had a lot of references to work with, except for the lobby.. and the stage with it being a school auditorium, it was the modeler's idea!
1:27:31 Q: "After a year of experience as a member of Hololive, is there anything you've learned about yourself or streaming that really stands out to you?
1:27:50 hic 
1:28:40 Maybe this is too serious or something, but I've always been the person to... when I stream and stuff, I learned to be more in control of myself, so you guys have a fun time and I'm not too crazy or how do I say... or too much of a bozo, yeah
1:28:53 Q:which game made ame get into fps?
1:29:02 TF2 watched pekora but she doesnt know if she cant trust us
1:29:47 had music for the credits but was muted for us
1:30:26 fishtank Do you have plans to make them channel mainstays?
1:30:39 I'm still waiting on something for Fish Tank, you'll understand why!
1:30:42 hic 

1:31:36 q Do you have any sneak peeks into what future creative streams you've had in mind for season 2
1:31:58 I can give you guys a heads up for this one, but maybe for Halloween or a later day, maybe compile 3D models you've made and put it in a museum!
1:32:51 show me your donut, thats sounds weird
1:33:04 Q:any official cover or originals?
1:33:08 I wanna say yes, but I'm not sure. My brain's not that type of creative...
1:34:07 Q:the thing that made her so passionated about hololive?
1:34:18 "I think you guys know this feeling you get sucked in 'cause it's just so exciting!
1:35:16 worked on a song before vacation but didnt like how it turned oout
1:35:58 though process on chosing pururin?
1:36:07 had permission and liked the song
1:36:22 Q: "How did you get so good at Project Management?
1:36:30 "I don't think I'm that good with it, but now that I've worked with more people, I was thinking about learning it more seriously... I dunno the process for live TV production, they have a control team and buttons and knobs and whatnot, I wanna learn the process for it so I can get better at it. And in the future, if I have projects, we can have a really good system for cues and getting everything timing-wise done! Yeah, Ame Productions! Setting up for the anniversary is fun! Maybe I just like being in control
1:37:42 maybe i like to be in control
1:38:21 : "Hey Ame, if you had to pick a stream that you had the most fun setting up and doing, which would it be and why
1:38:28 maybe the outfit reveal was really smooth
1:38:58 seeing you guys having fun is the best
1:39:26 biggest challenge and how does it feels to succed in the end?
1:40:00 We had senpais, but people are busy, and we're the first of EN. We were figuring out a lot of things... Hololive at a time was really big, but we didn't expect as much attention we got. Sometimes, I get a notification on my email that someone's trying to log in to my account
1:40:47 It's better for us not to talk about it... people try some stuff, and that's one of the things that causes anxiety that we don't talk about...(Talking about paranoid about security things)
1:42:08 Q:plans for a watchalong colalb?
1:42:11 That'd be fun! I asked Gura if we can watch Scarface together... wait, is it yabai?
1:42:49 Q :Was it last minute planend the collab?
1:43:04 It's sort of kinda last minute because there were some times we weren't sure that we weren't able to do it, but I had back up plans. We only got confirmation that everyone was ready for about 2-3 days before...
1:44:59 Making the schedule like that, planning the performances... what's the word I'm looking for.. I guess just communicating between everybody..
1:45:38 hic 
1:45:52 models will be released soon
1:48:04 looking 3d map modeler, didnt pay to the VR chat staff
1:49:48 "I undersold how much I should be paid [with my art] and they took advantage of it,
1:51:19 equipment used for anniv stream
1:51:39 eventually cooking stream (hic)
1:52:26 gonna ask recommendations to members for watchalongs
1:53:00 reason for 3d debut? its difficult at the moment to get into japan
1:53:34 how did ufelt when u met the holomyth member?
1:53:43 I remember when we all were, maybe two months before debut, we were getting to know each other... before we were able to move freely, I made my own [L2D] models out of the art we were provided! I also made stream assets for everybody, I was just super excited!
1:55:20 finding the layouts for the first collab
