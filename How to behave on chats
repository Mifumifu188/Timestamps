This is based on lyger's guide of stream ettiquete, but i think we needed a version that adapts more to EN chats.
Note this guide is directed to everyone, no one is excempt from breaking rules or being impolite,not you, not a famous person
and specially not me. Anyone can make mistakes or not realize that some acts you can do arent right to do during a stream.
 In short:  Just have common sense and courtesy 
but if it was so simple, everyone would behave, right?
Want a more a detailed explanation?
here are some things that you should consider on stream chat:
-First of all, always read the rules in the description to have a general idea.
-dont backseat unless the streamer ask( backseating consist on telling a streamer what to do while playing games babysiting them) the
streamer is experiencing a game and also wants to enjoy it, it comes of rude and keep in mind that there are more people 
that might do the same, its confusing for them, some people likes figuring out the things even if they take more time doing it than you.
You can always launch the game yourself if you want to see the game to be played in certain way.
-Dont be rude to the streamer or anyone, they are people after all,you can always communicate or give feedback on an appropiate way
without needing to be rude, they are doing their best to give you a fun time and they dont owe you anything.
-dont spam, needless to say more, theres a lot of people on the chat and everyone wants to interact with the streamer
 dont make it harder to read.
-sending money doesnt give you the right to say any rude or personal thing either
-the streamers are "responsible adults", they can take their own decisions on when to sleep/etc, you are not their mother.
-stay on topic and dont mention irrelevant things or streamers, remember a vtuber chat isnt a discord server with your friends
no one cares about your personal life or other streamers, and its personally rude. If someone wanted to talk about that thing
they would be in the appropiate chat for it.
-meme with responsibility, keep in mind that the are memes that are appropiated for the streams and some that arent (IE:racist,nsfw
unrlated,etc) even so, keep in mind that the streamer might not understand them and might be an uncomfortable time.
-the streamer isnt there just for you, they are not your friends/lover/family, they are just doing their job, as much they can love 
their audience they cant fullify the role of a close person to you, seek friends or therapy in that case.
-remember that vtubers are also real people that needs to keep some extra privacy, many people can be curious about them
but you cant invade their privacy, so stay clear of things that they havent explicity said on stream. "my friend told me"
or i read it on X place" isnt a valid excuse", its doxxing. If you see anyone mention some of those things and you suspect 
that its possible doxxing dont give it attention, just report and move on, otherwise you could confirm that info to more people.
-You see anyone doing any of the thing above what do i do? you are most likely not a moderator, neither someone relevant that can
do something, you are viewer, your job is enjoying the stream and supporting said streamer. The only thing you can do is ignore 
and report, having you policing the chat doesnt help of anything and creates a bad atmosphere on chat.

At the end of the day this is just too much text and doesnt cover everything, every chat has different atmospheres and different things that are acceptable
or not, just keep a minimum deegree of courtesy or try to learn how to behave on the specific chat, always show yourself supportive
and enjoy.
